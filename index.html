                error from the process.</li>
            <li>Helped improve and clarify the SEI CERT C Coding Standards, contributing guidance around secure C
                development.</li>
            <li>Built and shipped a scalable automation tool for SSL certificate renewals, saving engineers ~2 hours
                every
                renewal cycle.</li>
            <li>Designed user-friendly CLI tools that made it much faster to access system data, reducing log retrieval
